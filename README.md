# Todoey âœ“

## What I will create

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks. 

## Goal

I will make 3 different branches with one application, but implemented with different databases (UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm)

## Libraries

RealmSwift - mobile database is an open source, developer-friendly alternative to CoreData and SQLite
SwipeCellKit - swipeable UITableViewCell/UICollectionViewCell based on the stock Mail.app, implemented in Swift.
